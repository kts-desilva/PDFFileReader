Course 
Objectives 
To provide a broader understanding of architectural elements of a computer, how they 
work together, and fundamental building blocks. At the end of the module, you will be 
able to: 
 develop a simple microprocessor with a limited instruction set 
 list down the components of a computer and their functionalities 
 describe how a program is executed in a computer 
 sketch designs of controllers for various components in a computer system 
 evaluate the performance enhancement mechanisms in computer systems 
Required readings, labs, discussions, and field visit will enhance both the analytical and 
soft skills.

Syllabus We will start with a high-level design of a computer system and how various 
components work together. As we continue our exploration, we will gradually dig into 
specific sub-components of the system. The goal for the class is to be broad rather than 
deep. Our plan is to touch upon the following areas: 
1. Introduction to computer architecture [1 class] 
 Design goals, high-level design, architectural differences, programming levels 
2. Digital logic [2 classes] 
 Logic gates, Boolean algebra, k-maps, half and full adders, encoders, 
multiplexers  
3. Sequential logic [2 classes] 
 Flip-flops, registers, counters, state diagrams, clocks 
4. Instruction set [3 classes] 
 Micro operations, Assembly instructions, Harvard vs. Von Neumann 
architecture, RISC/CISC, addressing modes  
5. Data Representation [1 class] 
 Number systems, character representations 
6. Busses [0.5 class] 
 Busses, tri-state bus 
7. Memory [1.5 classes] 
 Memory hierarchy, types of memory, addressing modes, stack 
8. Input/Output [1 class] 
 Devices, text representation, pooling vs. interrupts, DMA 
9. Modern computing systems [2 classes] 
 Caching, pipelining, Amdahl’s law, hyper threading, multi-core, many-core

Workload 
Expectations 
There is a normative workload expected of you while following this module. This is a 3-
credit module. For the average student, this means 135 study hours over the semester. 
The following table provides a rough breakdown of how these hours might be spent 
over the whole semester – but this is only for guidance: 
 
Classes 
15 weeks × 2 hour lectures 30 
Independent work 
Labs 1 - 8 (8 Labs × 3 hour lab session) 24 
Homework (2) 6 
Preparatory work – e.g., set reading, contributing to LMS discussions, and 
preparation for lectures. 14 weeks × 4 hours a week 
56 
Group work 
Lab 9-10 (2 labs × 4 hour lab session) 8 
Field visit 9

Class policies  Topics to be discussed in each class will be posted on Moodle, along with relevant 
readings for each topic. You are expected to keep up with the readings as we go, as 
they will help provide the foundation for the homework, quizzes, and exam. 
Impromptu quizzes will be based on these assigned readings. 
 All students are expected to actively participate in class, Moodle, and Yammer 
activities. Poor participation and/or poor performance in assigned course work can 
be grounds for failure in the course. 
 Discussing and exchanging ideas through study groups are encouraged, as this 
usually leads to a better understanding. As part of the discussions, you may share 
ideas and thoughts, discuss the meaning of homework and lab questions, or possible 
ways of approaching a solution. However, you must write homework and lab 
solutions strictly. If one of your solutions is based on a key idea of someone else, 
you must acknowledge this in your homework, to avoid the perception of cheating. 
This form of collaboration is not an opportunity to copy answers from others.  
 Group assignments are given to encourage teamwork and discussion/toleration of 
alternative ideas/views; hence, they need to be done as a group. A penalty will be 
enforced for doing group assignments individually. 
 Plagiarism, copying another person’s work, letting another person copy your work, 
giving or receiving aid during any test or examination is all strictly not allowed. Any 
student caught in any of these will receive a failing grade regardless of marks earned 
on other assessed work. 
 Proper netiquette should be observed in using the Moodle and Yammer. 
 Each assigned work will have either a deadline for submission or a specific date for 
performance. For each day delayed beyond a deadline, 10% of marks will be 
deducted. Not performing (e.g., not doing a presentation) on an assigned date will 
result in 0 marks unless there is a valid reason and another student/group is arranged 
as a replacement. Details of submission will be given with each assignment. 
 The dictionary meaning of deadline is “the latest time or date by which something 
should be completed”. Thus, as you may already experience during your internship, 
deadlines are supposed to be met. 
 All quizzes and final exam will be closed book and closed note exams. The final 
exam will be comprehensive, covering material from the entire course including labs, 
homework, and filed visit. 
 You may not use cell phones, mp3 players, etc., during class. All laptops and mobile 
phones must be closed and all computer screens of the computers in the classroom 
must be turned off unless you use it to take notes, take photos of slides, or search 
for additional contents relevant to the ongoing class discussion. The reason is to 
prevent distractions to other students, and to prevent the temptation to check e-mail, 
Facebook, etc.
